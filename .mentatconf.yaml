# In such cases, you need to specify the maximum context manually.

#settings related to each "run"

# This list contains glob patterns. Mentat uses these patterns to exclude certain files when provided with a directory argument.
# Mentat considers all files that do not match your .gitignore file and these patterns.
# Glob patterns are interpreted from the git root location, so if you want to exclude all .py files, use "**/*.py" instead of "*.py".
# This example excludes all hidden files and directories:
file_exclude_glob_list:
#  - "**/.*"
#  - "**/.*/**"

#settings related to each "UI"

# This section contains key-value pairs for defining a custom Pygment Style for the Mentat prompt.
input_style:
  "" : "#9835bd"
  "prompt" : "#ffffff bold"
  "continuation" : "#ffffff bold"

#settings related to the "parser"

# Mentat parses files following a specific format, which you can set here.
# Multiple formats are available, though the default one is expected to be the best fit for most cases.
# You can experiment with different formats as per your need.
# Available formats include:  block, replacement, unified-diff.
